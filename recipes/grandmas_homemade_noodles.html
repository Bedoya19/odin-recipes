    <h2>The perfect homemade noodles recipe for soup, or to enjoy your favorite dishes</h2>
    <p>Make your own simple grandma's noodles with eggs, salt, and flour. Use it as an standalone meal or to accompanied other dishes.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup sifted all-porpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        </ul>>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine egg, milk, and salt in a bowl. Add sifted flour and stir until a dough forms, adding more flour as needed, a little at a time, for the dough to come together. Separate into two balls.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a work surface with flour and roll out each piece of dough as thin as you like. Let rolled dough rest for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut into strips and spread to dry, dusting with a bit of flour so the noodles don't stick together. Let dry for approximately 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Cook noodles in boiling salted water, or hot soup, until tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
